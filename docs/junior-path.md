# Junior Path: The Foundations

Welcome to the start of your journey.
In this tier, we do not build the shop yet. We build the **Tools** to build the shop.

## Curriculum
## Curriculum
1.  **[The Origin Story](./intro.md)**: Why Go?
2.  **[The Workbench](./setup.md)**: Installing Go and VS Code.

### Phase 1: The Foundations
*Before we build, we must know our tools.*
- **Basic Types**:
  - `int`: Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `500`).
  - `float64`: Decimals (e.g., `19.99`). *Why 64? It's more precise.*
  - `bool`: True/False logic.
  - `string`: Text.
- **Constants**:
  - `const TaxRate = 0.05`. *Why? Because it should never change.*
- **Arrays vs Slices**:
  - **Array**: Fixed size. Like a physical pill organizer (7 slots).
  - **Slice**: Dynamic. Use this 99% of the time. Like a Bookshelf (expandable).

### Phase 2: The Build
3.  **[Level 1: The Server](./lessons/01-server.md)**: Making it talk.
4.  **[Level 2: Structure](./lessons/02-structure.md)**: Templates & CSS.
5.  **[Level 3: Data](./lessons/03-data.md)**: Structs & Slices.
6.  **[Level 4: Interaction](./lessons/04-interaction.md)**: Forms & Validation.
7.  **[Level 5: Maps](./lessons/05-maps.md)**: The Catalog Index.
8.  **[The Bridge](./bridge.md)**: Crossing to Professional Engineering.

## The Goal
By the end of this path, you will be able to write a simple program that listens for HTTP requests and responds with text.

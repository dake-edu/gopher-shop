# Junior Path: The Foundations

Welcome to the start of your journey.
In this tier, we do not build the shop yet. We build the **Tools** to build the shop.

## Curriculum

2.  **[The Workbench](./setup.md)**: Installing Go and VS Code.
3.  **[The Anatomy](./anatomy.md)**: `package main`, `func main()`.
4.  **[Memory](./variables.md)**: variables, basic types, math.
5.  **[Logic](./logic.md)**: `if`, `switch`, booleans.
6.  **[Loops](./loops.md)**: `for`, arrays, slices, maps.
7.  **[Web Server](./first-server.md)**: `net/http`.

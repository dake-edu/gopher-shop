# The Gopher Shop 🐹📚

Welcome to the **The Gopher Shop** — a professional, hands-on educational journey designed to transform Go beginners into **Middle-level Backend Engineers**.

## 🚀 The Mission
Our goal is to build a production-ready REST API for a digital book store from scratch. We don't just teach syntax; we teach **architecture, patterns, and logic**.

## 🧠 Learning Methodology
This course uses a unique **Visual Anchor System**. Instead of long walls of text, we provide:
* **Core Signals:** Concise visual diagrams that represent complex logic.
* **Large-Block Learning:** We introduce the "Big Picture" first, then dive into the details.
* **Iteration Cycles:** The project evolves from a simple monolith to a sophisticated system.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **API:** RESTful with Clean Architecture
* **Documentation:** VitePress
* **Database:** PostgreSQL & Redis (later stages)

* **Online:** [View Documentation](https://dake-edu.github.io/gopher-shop/) *(Coming Soon)*

## 🗺 Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: The Monolith** (Basic API, In-memory storage)
2. **Phase 2: Persistence** (SQL, Migrations, Docker)
3. **Phase 3: The Middle Level** (Middleware, JWT, Unit Testing)
4. **Phase 4: Scalability** (Caching, Observability, CI/CD)
